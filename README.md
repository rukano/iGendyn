# iGendyn


This is the source code of the iGendyn iPhone app that was on the App Store circa 2010 but hasn't been available for a few years (I no longer maintain a developer account). Due to repeated requests I've made the source code available so people can build it themselves if they need it. I did a quick check that the project builds in a simulator, but note that it is Objective C++ and not Swift, and there are various deprecated method calls. I don't have an up to date iDevice, so provided without further checks. Hope it works for you!
